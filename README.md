### About This Project
The contents of this project were written in Visual Studio Code.

_Last updated: May 9th, 2023._

**I wrote published an academic research paper for this project — you can view
it in the International Journal of Computer Science & Information Technology
(IJCSIT) here:** https://doi.org/10.5121/ijcsit.2023.15501.

Although all team members' names appear in the publication, I was the sole
author of the paper, as I was the only member that was also in Dr. Vanamala's
research team.

# MY CONTRIBUTIONS
For this project, my resposibilities included:

- Writing (most of) the CSS for the homepage, Trivia, Key Hunter, and Phishing
Frenzy. 
- Assisting Ryan (rhrastic) with the JavaScript for Trivia and Phishing Frenzy,
as well as configuring the JSON storage for Trivia (`triviaQuestions.json`).
- Being the primary author of all project-related papers, UML diagrams, and
presentations. 
- Writing the project’s academic research paper, which was later accepted for
publication in a journal (see "About This Project").

You may notice that most of the JavaScript commits in my designated work areas
are credited to Ryan. This is because we used the Live Share VSCode extension,
with much of the work done on Ryan's local files.

# Overview
This project is a website designed to achieve four educational goals in a
gamified format:

- Help users learn and memorize general computer security terminology.
- Introduce basic cryptography concepts.
- Teach users how to quickly identify potential phishing scams via email.
- Educate users on common server attacks and how to respond to them.

The website was created with the intention of being used in Dr. Vanamala's
future courses at UW-Eau Claire. Whether it would serve as an example website or
as an interactive educational tool was left to her discretion.

The primary goal of the project, however, was to demonstrate our ability to
collaborate and coordinate as a team, simulating the experience of working in a
development environment.

## Which Folder Should I Be Using?
**`cs355` contains the final product.** All other folders were workshops of a
sort and needn't be viewed, although you may still do so.
